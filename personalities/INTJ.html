            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              INTJ individuals are perfectionists who strongly value personal
              freedom and competence. Driven by unshakable beliefs and
              originality, they work rigorously to achieve their goals. INTJs
              think critically, logically, and are strategic. They visualize the
              outcomes of plans and turn theoretical systems into tangible
              realities. Holding high expectations for themselves and others,
              INTJs often demand the same level of effort from those around
              them.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>
              INTJ (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging) is one of the 16
              personality types in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. In the
              Keirsey Temperament Sorter, it is referred to as the "Mastermind"
              and belongs to the Rational temperament group. INTJs are among the
              rarest types, making up only about 1% of the population.
            </p>
            <p>
              INTJs are known for their relentless drive to improve anything
              that captures their interest. Unlike idealists, they pursue
              excellence through pragmatic, action-oriented methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nicknamed "System Builders," INTJs possess a unique combination of
              vision and certainty. Their perfectionism and disdain for
              inefficiency can lead to demanding standards for both themselves
              and others. Authority is respected only if it aligns with their
              larger goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              INTJs are capable of making independent decisions without
              consulting others. They have a natural talent for recognizing
              opportunities, including those overlooked by others.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              INTJs excel in strategic thinking and theoretical concepts. They
              see the strengths and weaknesses in any situation, often becoming
              visionary organizers in areas they are passionate about. Once they
              form a plan, they dedicate remarkable focus, energy, and
              enthusiasm to seeing it through.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rational leaders often have a clear vision of the organization’s
              future and long-term development. INTJs meticulously consider all
              steps and convey their plans effectively, inspiring others to
              follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              As perfectionists, INTJs strive for innovation and exhibit
              extraordinary motivation when pursuing their ideas and goals. They
              analyze patterns, formulate long-term plans, and work with
              determination until their objectives are achieved.
            </p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              INTJs approach problems with clarity and logic, making judgments
              based on objective reasoning rather than emotions. They are
              self-reliant, unaffected by criticism, and highly independent.
              INTJs are excellent strategists, capable of synthesizing complex
              information and forming unique, creative solutions.
            </p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              INTJs may struggle to understand others, appearing overly
              self-focused or rigid in their standards. Their perfectionism and
              insistence on control can alienate others. They may overlook
              details that don’t fit their theoretical models and can become
              stubborn when pursuing their ideas.
            </p>
            <h3>Career Preferences</h3>
            <p>
              INTJs excel in fields requiring strategic planning and
              intellectual rigor. Suitable careers include:
