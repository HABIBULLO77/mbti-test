            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              ISTP (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perception) is one of the
              16 personality types in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and is
              referred to as "Virtuoso" in the Keirsey Temperament Sorter,
              falling under the Artisan category. ISTPs are calm and reserved,
              drawing energy from within rather than social interactions. They
              focus on tangible realities rather than abstract possibilities,
              paying more attention to details than the bigger picture. ISTPs
              prioritize logic over emotional considerations when making
              decisions, often reserving judgment and staying open to change.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>
              ISTPs excel in analyzing situations to identify the root of
              problems, enabling them to quickly implement practical solutions.
              This makes them ideal for fields like engineering. Naturally
              quiet, ISTPs are curious about how systems work and are drawn to
              efficient operations and structures. They remain open to new
              information and approaches, balancing their composed exterior with
              a knack for making insightful, often humorous observations. In
              private, they may enjoy high-speed or high-risk activities such as
              bungee jumping, racing, motorcycling, or skydiving, as well as
              professions like aviation or firefighting.
            </p>
            <p>
              While ISTPs sometimes act impulsively, their seemingly casual
              actions are grounded in years of accumulated knowledge and
              experience. They value self-sufficiency and take pride in finding
              innovative solutions to problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTPs respect others’ autonomy, expecting the same in return.
              However, if their personal boundaries are crossed, they will
              fiercely protect what they consider rightfully theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTPs are skilled in using various tools—artistic, technical, or
              even weapons. Though introverted, they can take initiative in
              interactions and have a significant influence on others. They
              focus on completing tasks efficiently and resourcefully.
            </p>
            <h3>Cognitive Functions</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Dominant Function: Introverted Thinking</strong> - Seeks
              precision, carefully categorizing and analyzing data to find the
              most efficient solutions with minimal risk. It evaluates logical
              inconsistencies within systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Auxiliary Function: Extraverted Sensing</strong> - Attuned
              to the present moment, it processes tangible details and may lead
              to spontaneous actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tertiary Function: Introverted Intuition</strong> -
              Synthesizes seemingly unrelated concepts into innovative outcomes,
              often finding symbolic meaning in patterns or complex systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Inferior Function: Extraverted Feeling</strong> - Aims to
              create harmonious social interactions by responding to others’
              needs, sometimes at the expense of their own.
            </p>
            <h3>Blind Spots</h3>
            <p>
              ISTPs tend to keep their thoughts and concerns private, making it
              difficult for others to understand their perspective. They should
              recognize the importance of sharing their experiences and provide
              precise explanations to others.
            </p>
            <p>
              While ISTPs are practical and resourceful, their tendency to avoid
              unnecessary effort can lead to cutting corners. Designing
              structured plans with clear steps can help them overcome this
              habit and maintain consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTPs often keep their options open, making them hesitant to
              commit to decisions. Setting clear goals and applying
              self-discipline can help mitigate this tendency and prevent
              impulsive or reckless behavior driven by a desire for stimulation.
            </p>
