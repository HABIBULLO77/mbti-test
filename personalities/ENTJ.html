            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              ENTJ: Extraversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging. ENTJ types are
              great leaders and decision-makers. They are visionary thinkers and
              long-term planners. With a strong sense of practicality and
              logical reasoning, ENTJs excel in tasks requiring intelligence and
              analytical skills. ENTJs value truth and only trust logic-driven
              conclusions. They are systematic in planning and exploring new
              ventures. Naturally enthusiastic and open leaders, ENTJs are good
              at organizing groups, living with discipline, and expecting others
              to follow suit. They embrace challenges and inspire others to work
              hard as they do.
            </p>

            <h3>Detailed Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              Friendly, determined, straightforward; honest and rational, with
              high standards for themselves and others; strive to showcase their
              abilities; have a global creative vision; capable, decisive, and
              organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              For ENTJs, the most important thing in life is showcasing their
              capabilities and accomplishing something significant. They are
              natural commanders and leaders. Whether as world leaders or
              religious figures, ENTJs exhibit charisma and leadership. They
              love to design plans before putting them into action.
            </p>
            <p>
              ENTJs often describe their projects and plans in a legendary tone,
              a skill useful in sales, comedy, and storytelling. Their natural
              ability to "block opposition" makes it hard for customers to
              refuse their requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              ENTJs are decisive. They know what needs to be done and delegate
              tasks effectively. Unlike other types, they remain resolute even
              in conflicts, defeating powerful opponents. When challenged, they
              become argumentative or exhibit a piercing gaze, sending a
              message: "Don't underestimate an ENTJ."
            </p>

            <h3>Blind Spots</h3>
            <p>
              ENTJs sometimes rush into decisions. Slowing down allows them to
              gather all relevant data and carefully consider the situation.
              However, ENTJs can be blunt, impatient, insensitive,
              uncompromising, and hard to approach. They need to listen to
              others' voices and appreciate their contributions. They may treat
              life too objectively, leaving little room for emotions. If their
              feelings are ignored, ENTJs become sensitive, especially when
              criticized by someone they respect. They may erupt over small
              matters, hurting those close to them. Learning to process and
              express emotions constructively instead of bottling them up will
              help ENTJs maintain self-control and achieve their goals.
              Accepting help from others can boost their capabilities and
              success.
