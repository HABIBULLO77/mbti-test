            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJ (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) individuals are
              serious, responsible, and logical members of society. They are
              trustworthy, value commitments, and treat their words as solemn
              vows. ISTJs are meticulous workers, practical thinkers, and
              realistic planners. They possess strong focus, organization, and
              precision, ensuring they are orderly and reliable in everything
              they do. Once they decide on the best course of action, they are
              resolute and determined to follow through.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJs are particularly quiet and diligent, with strong memory and
              judgment for details. They reference accurate facts to support
              their opinions and apply past experiences to current decisions.
              They value logical and objective analysis, completing tasks
              consistently and punctually. ISTJs prefer structured and organized
              approaches and are often impatient with others who deviate from
              these methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTJs are traditional and cautious by nature. They listen
              attentively and prefer clear, factual statements. Even in crises,
              they remain calm and composed. Although they appear steady and
              unchanging, beneath their composed exterior lies strong but rarely
              expressed emotions.
            </p>
            <h3>Function Usage</h3>
            <p>
              Extraversion and Introversion refer to the direction of
              psychological energy, while Judging and Perceiving are the two
              ways we approach tasks. Sensing and Intuition describe how we
              gather information, while Thinking and Feeling represent how we
              make decisions. These are collectively known as "functions" in
              psychology, the core of personality theory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone uses all four functions, but the preference for each
              varies. The first, or "dominant function," is the most utilized,
              followed by the "auxiliary function." Effective use of these
              functions is critical for personal development.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTJs' dominant function is Sensing, which focuses on details,
              while their auxiliary function is Thinking, emphasizing logical
              analysis. ISTJs are attentive to detail, value practicality, and
              excel in systematic tasks requiring patience and precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTJs use their Feeling and Intuition functions less effectively,
              even when situations demand them. Overusing their Sensing function
              may lead to overlooking broader concepts or failing to innovate,
              while overusing their Thinking function might make them neglect
              others' emotional needs.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJs primarily rely on their dominant function (Sensing) for
              decision-making, often overlooking their fourth function
              (Intuition). Effective decision-making requires a balanced use of
              all four functions:
            </p>
            <p>Dominant Function: Sensing</p>
            <p>Auxiliary Function: Thinking</p>
            <p>Third Function: Feeling</p>
            <p>Fourth Function: Intuition</p>
            <p>
              While achieving balance is challenging, acknowledging these
              functions can help ISTJs refine their decisions. In their
              professional lives, they should align their roles with their
              dominant and auxiliary functions, avoiding positions heavily
              reliant on their weaker functions.
            </p>
            <h3>Blind Spots</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJs often become absorbed in detailed planning and daily
              routines, making them rigid and resistant to alternative
              viewpoints. They may struggle with accepting unproven ideas or
              unconventional approaches unless they see immediate, practical
              benefits. They should consciously broaden their perspective,
              explore alternatives, and consider the long-term implications of
              their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              ISTJs may also struggle to understand needs different from their
              own. Their reserved nature can make them seem distant or
              unfeeling. They should express appreciation openly and remain
              flexible to others' viewpoints to foster better relationships.
            </p>
            <h3>Work Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJs are precise, organized, and methodical workers. They follow
              schedules, adhere to traditions, and focus intensely on tasks.
              Their strengths include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Attention to detail and accuracy</li>
              <li>Ability to work independently</li>

              <li>Dependability and a strong sense of responsibility</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Work Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              ISTJs may resist change, struggle with long-term patience, and
              focus excessively on immediate goals. They can appear rigid,
              overly critical, and resistant to untested methods. They should
              cultivate openness to innovation and flexibility in dynamic
              environments.
