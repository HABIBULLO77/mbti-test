              respond effectively. You are energetic and proactive, rarely
              confined by rules or standard procedures. You seek straightforward
              solutions to challenging problems to make your work enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an optimist, you are active, easygoing, and focused on enjoying
              the present. You are drawn to new experiences, activities, food,
              fashion, and people, living fully in the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curious and open-minded, you make decisions based on logical
              reasoning rather than emotions. If needed, you can exhibit strong
              willpower and prefer handling situations flexibly instead of rigid
              planning.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your focus on external stimuli and preference for handling crises

              failing to fulfill commitments, causing confusion for those around
