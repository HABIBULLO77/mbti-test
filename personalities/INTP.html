            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              INTP (Introverted/Intuitive/Thinking/Perceiving) is a personality
              type developed based on Jungian analytical psychology, MBTI,
              Keirsey Temperament Sorter, and social personality studies.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs are free-spirited creators and scholars with a penchant for
              abstract concepts and deep understanding. They are brimming with
              creativity but can be easily distracted.
            </p>
            <p>
              They enjoy impulsive ideas, which can be brilliant at times but
              also lead to confusion as new ideas continually emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
              They often find routine tasks with too many details or strict
              deadlines frustrating and may ask for extensions when facing
              deadlines.
            </p>
            <p>
              INTPs are highly talented in their chosen fields and can achieve
              exceptional heights in areas that align with their interests.
              However, in mundane aspects of daily life, they may struggle,
              appearing clumsy or absent-minded.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their adventurous nature may conflict with their preference for
              introspection, as the outside world can disrupt their reflective
              inner life.
            </p>
            <h3>Workplace Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs thrive when working alone, demonstrating creativity and
              energy. They approach tasks as intellectual challenges, enjoying
              brainstorming and meticulous planning before execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              They value independence, dislike ambiguity, and prefer structured,
              purposeful discussions. Their objectivity and analytical skills
              make them natural problem solvers.
            </p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs excel in understanding abstract concepts, generating
              innovative solutions, and working independently with focus and
              creativity. They are adept at analyzing vast amounts of
              information and adapting to new situations.
            </p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs may lack patience for routine details, struggle to express
              complex ideas clearly, and lose interest once a problem is solved.
              They may also neglect practical considerations, causing issues
              with implementation.
            </p>
            <h3>Career Preferences</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs enjoy roles that allow them to explore and solve complex
              systems. Examples include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Software designer, system analyst, and computer engineer</li>
              <li>Physicist, biologist, and pharmacist</li>
              <li>Economist, lawyer, and psychologist</li>
              <li>Photographer, writer, and inventor</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Relationship Insights</h3>
            <p>
              INTPs value intelligence in their partners and prefer logical
              compatibility over emotional connection. They may neglect
              emotional needs but can grow into supportive partners by
              leveraging their imagination and adaptability.
            </p>
            <h3>Development Tips</h3>
            <p>
              To succeed, INTPs should strive for better organization, develop
              patience with others, and enhance interpersonal skills to balance
              their logical nature with emotional awareness.
