            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              INFJ, representing Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Judging,
              is a type of Counselor personality. They have strong empathy,
              enabling them to perceive others' emotions or intentions. They are
              often excellent students. INFJ personalities are suitable for
              roles such as medical consultants, playwrights, art advisors, and
              writers. Creative, independent, detail-oriented, and warm-hearted,
              they possess a global perspective, unique insights, and high
              enthusiasm. Methodical, organized, and capable decision-makers,
              they are among the four types of Idealists.
            </p>

            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>
              Counselors (INFJ) seek meaning and connections in ideas,
              relationships, and material things. They desire to understand what
              motivates people, displaying strong insight into others. They are
              responsible and adhere to their values. They have a clear vision
              of how to better serve the public. In achieving their goals, they
              are planned and decisive.
            </p>

            <p>
              INFJs are loyal, determined, and idealistic. They value integrity
              and remain firm. Their persuasive abilities and clear views on
              what benefits the public good make them great leaders. Their
              contributions earn respect and admiration. Cherishing friendships
              and harmony, INFJs prefer to persuade others through encouragement
              and praise rather than conflict or threats. They willingly inspire
              peers and avoid disputes.
            </p>

            <p>
              INFJs live in a world of ideas. Independent, original thinkers
              with strong emotions, principles, and integrity, they trust their
              own judgments even in the face of doubt. They prioritize their
              beliefs above all else, including popular opinion and authority.
              This inner conviction fuels their enthusiasm.

              Often a perfect match, the Counselor, who is reserved, strategic,
              complex, and mysterious, complements the Inventor, who is outgoing
              and explorative. Counselors find great relief from Inventors, who
              enjoy helping these structured individuals discover their essence
              and meaning.
            </p>

            <h3>About Family</h3>
            <p>
              These soft-spoken guides seek family harmony and believe that both
              visible and hidden conflicts can disrupt their happiness. Their
              social circles may be small but are often deep and lasting. They
              are faithful partners and responsible parents, striving for close,
              nurturing relationships.
            </p>

            <h3>About Leadership</h3>
            <p>
              As understated guides, they passionately influence the growth of
              others. With rare, intuitive recognition of others’ needs and
              abilities, they encourage personal exploration. Although their
              quiet nature may make them seem less prominent in leadership
              roles, their impact on organizations is significant and lasting.
            </p>

            <h3>Love</h3>
            <p>
              INFJs are passionate, empathetic, and deeply emotional in their
              relationships. They seek profound and meaningful emotional
              connections. Their perfectionist tendencies drive them to seek the
              deepest forms of love. They often aim for lifelong, meaningful
              relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
              INFJs’ Strengths in Relationships: Passionate, empathetic,
              sensitive to others' feelings, excellent communicators (especially
              in writing), and strong listeners.
            </p>
            <p>
              INFJs’ Weaknesses in Relationships: Tendency to withhold parts of
              themselves, dislike for conflict and criticism, difficulty in
              letting go of unfulfilled relationships, and struggles with
              day-to-day practicalities like finances.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Advice</h3>
            <p>
              Keys to INFJ success: Pay attention to details, learn to be
