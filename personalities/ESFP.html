            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              ESFPs are eager to interact with others and have a genuine passion
              for life. They are playful, energetic, and make others feel more
              engaged through their humor and sincerity. They are friendly,
              adaptable, warm, and generous. Often the center of attention, they
              enjoy participating in various activities and quickly adapt to new
              situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outgoing, friendly, and inclusive. They love life, people, and
              material pleasures. They enjoy working with others and make tasks
              enjoyable through practicality and common sense. Flexible and
              spontaneous, they easily accept new friends and adapt to new
              environments. They learn best when engaging in activities with
              others.
            </p>
            <p>
              ESFPs are realistic observers who handle things as they are. They
              trust what they can directly experience, like hearing, seeing, or
              touching, rather than relying on theoretical explanations. With
              great memory for details and a preference for hands-on learning,
              they excel by gaining knowledge through experience. They are
              tolerant, empathetic, and approachable, making them excellent at
              resolving conflicts and bringing people together. They genuinely
              enjoy helping others in tangible ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flexible and patient, they focus on results and find theoretical
              or abstract explanations uninteresting. They take action to solve
              problems, enjoying the moment and valuing material comforts and
              fashion. They learn best through direct experience and practice.
            </p>

            <h3>Basic Description</h3>
            <p>The Performer – Always seeking new challenges.</p>
            <p>
              You love entertaining others and giving your all to bring joy,
              laughter, and energy to yourself and those around you. As a
              Performer, you thrive in the spotlight and enjoy interacting with
              everyone in your social circle. Solitude is your least favorite
              situation, but fortunately, you're rarely alone. For true
              Performers, life is an endless celebration.
            </p>

            <h3>Potential Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              Since you focus on external changes and enjoy handling
              emergencies, you may avoid planning to prevent issues. You often
              take on too much, which can lead to broken promises and cause
              confusion for others. It’s essential to find ways to complete
              tasks on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              You focus entirely on fun activities and constantly seek new
              challenges, which may prevent you from recognizing the
              consequences of your actions. You should establish personal
              standards and learn to consider others’ feelings when
              circumstances change.
